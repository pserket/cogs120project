Dancers Web Application Project

We made a web application for dancers. The main goal is to help dancers learn dances from songs by providing an application that has tools to enable it. Users can upload songs, and create projects where while the songs play, notes or pictures will show up on the screen for them at times they choose. Not only for learning songs, the basic tools of changing the playback rate, as well as setting an automatic looping function by selecting the range of time to play between are useful for all dancers. These are simple needs that we thought could be addressed from our own dance experience and going to dance workshops. 

We have a login function because we envisioned an idea where users could upload their songs with notes or reminders so others could use it to practice dancing.
